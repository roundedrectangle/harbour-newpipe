 * @brief Dynamically-sized and bounds-safe binary buffer
 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * The buffer class provides a generic dynamically-defined buffer for
 * storing sequences of bytes. As data is appended to the buffer memory
 * will be allocated automatically in blocks. The block size can be set
 * when the buffer is first created.
 *
 * Buffers have a length and and are also guaranteed to be zero-byte
 * terminated. The zero-byte is not included in the length (but the
 * underlying buffer size, which is often different from the size of the
 * contents, will always be large enough to contain it). The contents can
 * itself contain zero bytes, or indeed anything else.
 *
